Ideas to share
==============

I created this repo just to add one issue per idea that I would like to share with the world.

Most of them will be software projects that I would like to develop at home, but I don't have the time, the knowledge or the needed enthusiasm.

So here we go! Feel free to steal any idea and become millionaire with it. I will only ask for your thanks (and maybe a job) in case you find something worth building within the bunch of silly stuff that comes out of my mind.


Thanks for reading!
